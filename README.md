## üß™ Pipeline Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**
   - Download datasets, label images, clean duplicates.
   - Apply augmentations: Rotation, Flip, Shear, Zoom, etc.
2. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Resize: 224√ó224 (EfficientNet), 256√ó256 (ResNet), 416√ó416 (YOLOv4-tiny)
   - Normalize pixel values.
3. **Leaf Detection**
   - YOLOv4-tiny detects bounding box for the leaf region.
   - Crop image around the detected box.
4. **Feature Extraction**
   - EfficientNetB0 and ResNet-50V2 generate feature vectors.
5. **Feature Fusion**
   - Concatenate vectors into one (e.g., 3328-dim).
6. **Classification**
   - Trained Random Forest makes the final prediction.
7. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.
